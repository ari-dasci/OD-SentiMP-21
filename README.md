## Dataset details

The dataset containst 1500 tweets from three different countries: Greece (500 tweets), Spain (500 tweets) and United Kingdom (500 tweets). For each tweet we provide the following information:
* **tweet_id**: Which represents the identifier of each tweet.
* **full_text**: Which containts the content of the tweet.
* **mp_party**: Party to which the member of parliament who wrote the tweet belongs.
* **mp_name**: Name of the member of parliament who wrote the tweet.
* **created_at**: Date of the tweet.
* **label_i** : Annotator's i label (i in {1,2,3} for English and Greek and i in {1,2,3,4,5} for Spanish). It takes values in {-1,0,1,x}.
* **majority_vote**: The result after applying the majority vote strategy to the annotators' partial labelling. When there is a tie we use the label "TIE". It takes values in {-1,0,1,TIE}.
* **tie_break**:  We use this column to break ties in cases where there is a tie. Therefore, it is only completed when TIE appears in the *majority_vote* column. It takes values in {-1,0,1}.
* **final_label**: It represents the final label. It is a combination between the *majority_vote* abd the *tie_break* columns. It takes values in {-1,0,1}.

## Downloads

We release three different version for each of the datasets:

* Extended version (full): We include all the columns for each of the initial 500 tweets.
* Extended version (without x): We delete the tweets labeled with "x" from the previous version.
* Simple version: It only keeps the columns *tweet_id*, *full_text* and *final_label* from the previous version.
